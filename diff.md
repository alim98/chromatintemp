Your pipeline generally aligns with the reference sheet, but with some differences. Here's a comparison:

### Alignment ✓
1. **Overall Structure**:
   - Both follow the data → model → loss → inference pattern
   - Both handle shape and texture separately
   - Both include coarse (lowres) and fine (highres) texture models

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Your pipeline uses similar preprocessing steps (normalization to [0,1] range)
   - Handles similar inputs (meshes, point clouds)
   - Uses similar data structures and dimensions

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - Your texture models use UNet3D with similar channel structure
   - You have separate models for shape and different texture resolutions

### Differences/Potential Gaps ⚠️
<!-- 1. **Loss Functions**:
   - Your current implementation uses BCELoss for texture
   - The reference uses NT-Xent and combined losses (NT-Xent + MSE + regularization)

2. **Training Strategy**:
   - The reference uses contrastive learning with positive/negative pairs
   - Your pipeline may not explicitly implement this contrastive approach -->

3. **Augmentation**:
   - The reference mentions ARAP deformations and geometric/intensity augmentations
   - Your script doesn't show explicit augmentation configuration

4. **Post-processing**:
   - The reference includes standard-scaling features and context feature building
   - Your pipeline currently focuses on embedding generation

5. **Tensor Dimensions**:
   - Some dimensions may differ slightly (e.g., the reference specifies B×1×D×H×W = B×1×144×144×144)

If you want to align your pipeline more closely with the reference, you might need to:

1. Implement the contrastive learning approach with NT-Xent loss
2. Add the augmentation strategies mentioned
3. Ensure the tensor dimensions match exactly
4. Implement the reconstruction branch for texture models
5. Add the post-processing steps like standard-scaling
